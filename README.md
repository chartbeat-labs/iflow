Demo

You can see this hack in action on [chartbeat.github.com/iflow](http://chartbeat.github.com/iflow).

Configure
---------

Edit `config.js` to select the tracked `host` and a corresponding `apikey`. 
All allowed settings are listed at the top of `iflow.js`, including some color scheme related variables.

iFlow allows you to override all settings through URL parameters. For example:

	chartbeat.github.com/iflow?host=myhost.com&apikey=secret
